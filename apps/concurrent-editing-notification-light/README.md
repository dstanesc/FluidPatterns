# Investigates concurrent editing notification, lightweight implementation

Lightweight solution for the concurrent editing problem described at large in the _concurrent editing notification_ [sibling project](../concurrent-editing-notification/)

Although highly efficient, current approach is impractical for complex applications as lacks good encapsulation. 

The solution leverages undocumented and possibly evolving _PropertyDDS_:
- internal API. 
- serialization format.
- internal state transitions

For the same reason the solution lacks portability.
