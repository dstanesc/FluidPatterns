# Array Slice Property Data Binding 

__Work In Progress ...__

This exercise investigates using the PropertyDDS DataBinder directly for dynamic path registration.
The code complexity is comparable to the [Data Binding](../array-property-binding/) solution.

> Note: While algorithms are similar, listener registration paths are absolute (compared to the relative paths in the Data Binding exercise)

# Getting Started

Needed dependencies
