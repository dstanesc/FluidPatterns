# Array Slice Property Data Binding 

This exercise investigates the capabilities of the PropertyDDS `DataBinding` API to extract dynamic data fragments. 

The emerging conclusion is that while the pattern remains a possibility, the usage seems to stretch the original design intentions in case of dynamic binding registration.

The `type` association with the `DataBinding` seems however to play very well when the data definition & navigation is static in nature. The `DataBinding` promotes good modularity and consistency in behavior (ie data is extracted consistently from data of same category/type)
